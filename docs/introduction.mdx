# Your Code is Shipping Faster Than You Can Learn It Developers are facing a new problem: **Knowledge Debt**. AI tools write code faster than humans can understand it. You're shipping features you don't fully comprehend. PRs merge with gaps. Bugs compound. Velocity looks great until it doesn't. **The cost?** 8 hours per week lost searching. \$30K per developer per year in wasted productivity. For a 100-person team, that's \$3M annually burned on context switching. \<Card title="The Problem" icon="triangle-exclamation" color="#ef4444"\> Developers leave their flow the moment they get stuck. Google → Stack Overflow → ChatGPT → Docs → Back to code. **23 minutes to recover from each context switch.** \</Card\> ## Gradientflo: Agentic Learning for GitHub-Native Developers We built the intelligence layer that sits **between your code and your comprehension**. Instead of leaving GitHub to learn, **we turn your PRs into 10-minute ByteCourses** that teach you the exact concepts you need, using your own code as the example. \<Card title="The Solution" icon="sparkles" color="#10b981"\> **Agentic Learning** = Contextual, interactive, personalized learning generated from _your actual code_. Not generic tutorials. Not Stack Overflow answers. **Your PR becomes your textbook.** \</Card\> ## How It Works: The Loop Every time you open a PR, Gradientflo activates: \`\`\`mermaid graph LR A[Discover] --\> B[Recommend] B --\> C[Educate] C --\> D[Examine] D --\> E[Assess] E --\> F[Showcase] F --\> A \`\`\` **Discover** → We analyze your PR diff, test failures, and code patterns **Recommend** → AI detects skill gaps and suggests a targeted ByteCourse **Educate** → 10-minute interactive lesson with voice, artifacts, and your code **Examine** → Apply what you learned, push new commits **Assess** → Quick quiz validates mastery **Showcase** → Your skill graph updates with evidence-backed proof **Total time:** 10 minutes. **Context switches:** Zero. ## Copilot Writes Code. Gradientflo Teaches You Code. \<CardGroup cols={2}\> \<Card title="GitHub Copilot" icon="robot"\> Generates code for you. You ship faster. You understand less. \</Card\> \<Card title="Gradientflo" icon="graduation-cap"\> Teaches code to you. You ship smarter. You understand everything. \</Card\> \</CardGroup\> ## Built for 180M GitHub-Native Developers We're not trying to teach "all developers." We focus on the developers who: - Ship daily on GitHub - Work in teams with PR reviews - Use modern CI/CD pipelines - Care about code quality and upskilling **The market:** 1 billion commits in 2025. 4.3M AI-generated repositories. This is where professional development happens now. ## What Makes Us Different | Traditional Learning | Gradientflo (Agentic Learning) | |---------------------|--------------------------------| | Generic courses | Personalized from your code | | 2-hour videos | 10-minute ByteCourses | | No context | PR-driven context | | Disconnected from work | Embedded in GitHub | | You forget it | Your skill graph proves it | ## The New Resume Your resume isn't a PDF anymore. It's a **Knowledge Graph** showing: - Concepts mastered (with evidence links to PRs) - Learning velocity (how fast you upskill) - Patterns understood (architecture, testing, security) - Team intelligence (collective skill mapping) \<Note\> **Category-defining metric:** We invented **Learning Velocity Index (LVI)** — the cycle time for upskilling. It's like DORA metrics for learning. \</Note\> ## Early Proof: Sarah's Redis Caching PR **Old way:** 2 hours Googling "Redis caching best practices" **New way:** 10-minute ByteCourse generated from her own PR **Impact:** - 110 minutes saved - 90% knowledge retention (vs 20% from videos) - Skill graph updated with evidence - Next PR ships with zero Redis errors ## The Vision **Close the comprehension gap.** Developers should understand code at AI velocity, not just ship it. Gradientflo makes that possible. \<Card title="Ready to Ship Smarter?" icon="rocket" href="/quickstart"\> Connect GitHub in 2 minutes → \</Card\>
