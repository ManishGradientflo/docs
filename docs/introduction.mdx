Your code is shipping faster than you can learn it. Developers today face a new problem: **Knowledge Debt**. AI tools write code faster than humans can understand it. You’re shipping features you don’t fully comprehend. Pull requests merge with gaps. Bugs accumulate. Velocity looks great—until it doesn’t.

The cost is enormous: developers lose 8 hours per week searching for information. That’s \$30,000 per developer per year in wasted productivity. For a 100-person engineering team, that becomes **\$3 million burned annually on context switching**.

Developers break flow the moment they get stuck. They jump from Google, to Stack Overflow, to ChatGPT, to documentation, and then back to code. Each context switch takes 23 minutes to recover.

## **Gradientflo: Agentic Learning for GitHub-Native Developers**

Gradientflo is the intelligence layer that sits between your code and your comprehension. Instead of leaving GitHub to learn anything, Gradientflo converts your pull requests into short, 10-minute “ByteCourses” that teach you the exact concepts you need—using your own code as the example.

This is contextual, interactive, personalized learning generated from your codebase. Not generic tutorials. Not disconnected Q&A. Your PR literally becomes your textbook.

---

## **How It Works**

Every time you open a pull request, Gradientflo activates and follows this loop:

**Discover** – Your PR diff, test failures, and code patterns are analyzed.\
**Recommend** – AI detects skill gaps and suggests the right ByteCourse.\
**Educate** – You take a short interactive lesson with your own code.\
**Examine** – You apply what you learned and push new commits.\
**Assess** – A quick quiz verifies understanding.\
**Showcase** – Your skill graph updates automatically.

The entire cycle takes 10 minutes.\
Context switching: zero.

## **Copilot Writes Code. Gradientflo Teaches You Code.**

GitHub Copilot generates code so you ship faster—but often understand less.\
Gradientflo teaches you the underlying concepts so you ship smarter and retain what you learn.

---

## **Built for 180 Million GitHub-Native Developers**

Gradientflo focuses on developers who:

- Ship code daily on GitHub
- Work in teams with PR reviews
- Use modern CI/CD pipelines
- Care about both speed and code quality
- Want to continuously upskill

The market is massive:\
1 billion commits in 2025, and 4.3 million AI-generated repositories.\
This is where professional learning now happens.

---

## **What Makes Gradientflo Different**

Traditional learning relies on generic, lengthy courses with no connection to your work.\
Gradientflo provides:

- Personalized lessons generated from your PRs
- 10-minute ByteCourses instead of long videos
- Context directly tied to real code
- Learning embedded inside GitHub
- A skill graph that proves retention

---

## **The New Resume**

Your resume is no longer a PDF. It becomes a **Knowledge Graph** showing:

- Concepts you've mastered
- Evidence linked to specific PRs
- Your learning velocity
- Patterns you understand (architecture, testing, security)
- Team-level intelligence and skill trends

Gradientflo introduced a category-defining metric: **Learning Velocity Index (LVI)**—the cycle time for upskilling. It’s like DORA metrics, but for developer learning.

## **Early Proof: Sarah’s Redis Caching PR**

In the old workflow, Sarah spent 2 hours Googling “Redis caching best practices.”\
With Gradientflo, she received a 10-minute ByteCourse based on her own PR.

The impact:

- 110 minutes saved
- 90% retention (compared to ~20% from video tutorials)
- Her skill graph updated with verified evidence
- Her next PR shipped with zero Redis errors

---

## **The Vision**

Close the comprehension gap.\
Developers should understand code at AI velocity—not just ship it.\
Gradientflo makes that possible.
