# Knowledge Graph

Your Knowledge Graph is a **Neo4j-powered network** showing how your skills connect, evolve, and compound.

## Why Graphs > Lists

Traditional resumes:
✅ React
✅ TypeScript
✅ Node.js

Your Knowledge Graph shows:
- How skills relate (React + TypeScript + Next.js cluster)
- What you learned recently (node recency colors)
- Proficiency levels (node sizes)
- Skill dependencies (edges between nodes)
- Evidence links (which PRs prove each skill)

## How It's Built

Every ByteCourse completion updates your graph:

```cypher
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})
CREATE (u)-[:LEARNED {
  evidence: "PR-456",
  confidence: 0.85,
  timestamp: "2025-01-15"
}]->(s:Skill {name: "Error Handling"})

**Nodes:** Skills (size = proficiency, color = recency)

**Edges:** Relationships (prerequisite, related, applied together)

**Clusters:** Domains (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, AI/ML)

## What You Can Do

- **Explore:** Click a skill to see prerequisites and related concepts
- **Find Gaps:** Gray nodes = skills you should learn next
- **Track Growth:** Watch your graph expand over time
- **Share:** Public profile includes embeddable graph widget

## Privacy

Your graph is **private by default**. You control visibility per skill.
