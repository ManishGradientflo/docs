Your Knowledge Graph is a **Neo4j-powered network** showing how your skills connect, evolve, and compound.

## Why Graphs \> Lists

Traditional resumes: ✅ React ✅ TypeScript ✅ Node.js

Your Knowledge Graph shows:

- How skills relate (React + TypeScript + Next.js cluster)
- What you learned recently (node recency colors)
- Proficiency levels (node sizes)
- Skill dependencies (edges between nodes)
- Evidence links (which PRs prove each skill)

## How It's Built

Every ByteCourse completion updates your graph:

```cypher
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})
CREATE (u)-[:LEARNED {
  evidence: "PR-456",
  confidence: 0.85,
  timestamp: "2025-01-15"
}]->(s:Skill {name: "Error Handling"})
```

**Nodes** represent skills. Their size indicates proficiency, and their color indicates recency.\
**Edges** represent relationships such as prerequisites, related skills, or skills that are commonly applied together.\
**Clusters** group skills into broader domains such as Frontend, Backend, DevOps, or AI/ML.

## **Three Layout Modes**

Your Knowledge Graph can be viewed in three different visualization layouts:

**Force-Directed** – Creates natural clusters of related skills.\
**Hierarchical** – Shows skill dependencies in a tree-like structure.\
**Circular** – Displays skills in a ring for easier proficiency comparison.

## **What You Can Do With the Graph**

- **Explore:** Click any skill to see related concepts and prerequisites.
- **Find Gaps:** Skills shown in gray represent areas you can learn next.
- **Track Growth:** Watch your graph expand as you learn over time.
- **Share:** Your public profile includes an embeddable version of the graph.

---

## **Privacy**

Your Knowledge Graph is private by default. You can choose what becomes visible and what stays hidden, on a per-skill basis.

## **Call to Action**

You can open your profile to view your Knowledge Graph anytime.
