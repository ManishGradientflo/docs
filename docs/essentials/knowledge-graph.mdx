Knowledge Graph

Your Knowledge Graph is a Neo4j-powered network that shows how your skills connect, evolve, and compound over time.

Why Graphs Are Better Than Lists

Traditional resumes simply list skills like:

React

TypeScript

Node.js

A Knowledge Graph goes much deeper. It shows:

How skills relate to each other (for example, React + TypeScript + Next.js forming a cluster)

What you learned recently, using recency-based node colors

Proficiency levels, represented by node sizes

Dependencies between skills, shown through connecting edges

Evidence for each skill, linked to the pull requests where the skill was demonstrated

How the Graph Is Built

Every time you complete a ByteCourse, your Knowledge Graph is updated with a new skill relationship. For example:

MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})
CREATE (u)-[:LEARNED {
  evidence: "PR-456",
  confidence: 0.85,
  timestamp: "2025-01-15"
}]->(s:Skill {name: "Error Handling"})


Nodes represent skills. Their size indicates proficiency, and their color indicates recency.
Edges represent relationships such as prerequisites, related skills, or skills that are commonly applied together.
Clusters group skills into broader domains such as Frontend, Backend, DevOps, or AI/ML.

Three Layout Modes

Your Knowledge Graph can be viewed in three different visualization layouts:

Force-Directed – Creates natural clusters of related skills.
Hierarchical – Shows skill dependencies in a tree-like structure.
Circular – Displays skills in a ring for easier proficiency comparison.

What You Can Do With the Graph

Explore: Click any skill to see related concepts and prerequisites.

Find Gaps: Skills shown in gray represent areas you can learn next.

Track Growth: Watch your graph expand as you learn over time.

Share: Your public profile includes an embeddable version of the graph.

Privacy

Your Knowledge Graph is private by default. You can choose what becomes visible and what stays hidden, on a per-skill basis.

Call to Action

You can open your profile to view your Knowledge Graph anytime.
