# Learning Velocity Index (LVI) **LVI measures how fast you turn learning into applied skill.** It's cycle time for developer upskilling. ## The Formula LVI = (Concepts Mastered × Applied in Codebase) ÷ Time **Concepts Mastered:** ByteCourses completed + quizzes passed **Applied in Codebase:** Skills used in PRs (detected via code patterns) **Time:** Days from introduction to mastery ## Example You complete 4 ByteCourses in 2 weeks: - Unit Testing ✅ → Applied in PR-456 - Next.js App Router ✅ → Applied in PR-459 - OAuth 2.0 ✅ → Applied in PR-462 - React Server Components → Not yet applied **Calculation:** LVI = (3 skills × 100%) ÷ 14 days = 0.21 skills/day LVI Score: 68/100 ## Score Range **0-30:** Learning but not applying **31-60:** Steady application **61-85:** Rapid upskilling **86-100:** Elite velocity ## What Impacts Your Score **✅ Positive:** - Complete ByteCourses - Apply skills within 7 days - Fix detected gaps - Pass quizzes on first try **❌ Negative:** - Long gaps between learning and application (\>14 days) - Abandon courses mid-way - Ignore recommended courses ## Why It Matters \<CardGroup cols={2}\> \<Card title="For You" icon="user"\> Prove fast learning.
