title: "Learning Velocity Index (LVI)"
description: "The cycle time for upskilling. Your north star metric."
---


LVI measures how quickly you turn learning into applied skill.\
It is essentially the cycle time for developer upskilling.

---

## **The Formula**

**LVI = (Concepts Mastered × Applied in Codebase) ÷ Time**

- **Concepts Mastered:** ByteCourses completed plus quizzes passed
- **Applied in Codebase:** Skills detected in your PRs through code patterns
- **Time:** Number of days between being introduced to a concept and mastering it

---

## **Example**

You complete 4 ByteCourses in 2 weeks:

- Unit Testing — applied in PR-456
- Next.js App Router — applied in PR-459
- OAuth 2.0 — applied in PR-462
- React Server Components — not yet applied

Calculation:\
LVI = (3 skills × 100%) ÷ 14 days = **0.21 skills per day**

LVI Score: **68/100**

---

## **Score Range**

- **0–30:** Learning but not applying
- **31–60:** Steady application
- **61–85:** Rapid upskilling
- **86–100:** Elite learning velocity

---

## **What Impacts Your Score**

### Positive Factors

- Completing ByteCourses
- Applying skills within 7 days
- Fixing detected gaps
- Passing quizzes on the first attempt

### Negative Factors

- Long delays between learning and applying (\>14 days)
- Not finishing courses
- Ignoring recommended courses

---

## **Why LVI Matters**

**For You:**\
It proves fast learning.\
Example: “LVI 72 = more than 3 skills mastered per month.”

**For Teams:**\
It measures onboarding and group learning velocity.\
Example: “New hires reach LVI 50+ within 45 days.”
