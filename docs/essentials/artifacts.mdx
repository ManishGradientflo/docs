Every ByteCourse includes artifacts — visual and interactive learning materials generated directly from your pull request.

## **12 Artifact Types**

**AI Docs**\
Markdown-style documentation that includes code snippets. This is the default fallback artifact.

**AI Slides**\
Visual slide-style breakdowns that include diagrams, explanations, and annotated notes.

**Mindmaps**\
Hierarchical concept maps that show how ideas, components, and patterns connect to each other.

**AI Images**\
Automatically generated diagrams, flowcharts, and UI mockups that explain your code visually.

**Architecture Diagrams**\
System-level diagrams showing data flow, component interactions, and backend architecture.

**SVG Diagrams**\
Vector-based technical illustrations with clean, scalable graphics.

**Web Pages**\
Interactive HTML demos that run inside a sandboxed iframe.

**Mini Apps**\
Small runnable code examples that demonstrate the concept from your PR with real outputs.

**Flowcharts**\
Process flows, decision trees, and algorithm steps visualized for clarity.

**AI Sheets**\
Structured tables such as comparison matrices, feature tables, data sets, or test cases.

**Code Playgrounds**\
Live coding environments where you can experiment using the context of your own PR.

**API Explorers**\
Interactive API documentation with the ability to send test requests in a safe demo environment.

## **Example: Redis Caching Course**

Your pull request contained a basic Redis implementation.\
The following artifacts were generated for the ByteCourse:

- An architecture diagram showing cache flow (application → Redis → database)
- A mini app demonstrating live Redis commands using your data structure
- A flowchart explaining the cache invalidation decision tree
- A code playground for testing different TTL (time-to-live) strategies

All artifacts were generated in under 60 seconds.

## **Security**

All interactive artifacts run inside sandboxed iframes with a strict Content Security Policy.\
There is no external navigation, and the artifact cannot access the parent window.

## **Call to Action**

You can view real examples of generated artifacts created from real pull requests in the examples section.
