## **How to Set It Up**

**Install the App (30 seconds)**\
Go to Settings → Integrations → Connect GitHub.\
The integration requires the following scopes:

- `repo:read` — to read pull request diffs and commits
- `pull_requests:write` — to post ByteCourse comments
- `checks:read` — to access CI/CD results

**Select Repositories**\
Choose which repositories Gradientflo should monitor. You can add more at any time.

**Webhooks Auto-Configure**\
Gradientflo automatically listens for the following GitHub events:

- `pull_request` (opened, updated, closed)
- `workflow_run` (CI/CD completed)
- `pull_request_review` (submitted)

## **What Happens Next**

1. You open a pull request — the intelligence layer activates within about 5 seconds.
2. Gap detection runs by analyzing the diff, tests, coverage, and complexity.
3. A ByteCourse comment is posted to your PR with a personalized course link.
4. You take a 10-minute interactive lesson.
5. You apply what you learned and push commits — this triggers re-analysis.
6. Verification happens automatically. If the gap is resolved, you receive a success comment and your Skill Graph updates.

## **Privacy**

We access:

- Pull request metadata
- File diffs
- CI/CD results

We do **not** access:

- Secrets
- Environment variables
- Private issues

Storage policy:\
File diffs are cached for 24 hours and then deleted.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

If comments are not appearing in pull requests:

- Check webhook delivery logs in GitHub Settings.
- Verify that the `pull_requests:write` permission is enabled.
- Confirm that the repository is included in the monitored list.
